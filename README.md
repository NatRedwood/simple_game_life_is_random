A simple game created in Python just for fun.

# Game Life Is Random

Game Life Is Random is my first code, a simple game written in Python right after getting started with the language.
It's a very basic code written to make the first days of learning Python fun and get into OOP.

## Description

The game asks simple questions and provides the outputs based on the users' answers.

## Usage

The game doesn't require any more packages but random.

```python
import random

# returns 'Hello! What's your name?'
main.code()

# returns randomly chosen name from the list specified by the user
self.partner_name = random.choice(self.my_names)

# returns randomly chosen type of dwelling from the list specified by the code
self.dwelling = random.choice(dwellings_list)

#returns the number of kids based on the level of craziness specified by the user before

self.get_craziness()

if 0 <= self.craziness < 25:
  self.kid = random.choice(quarter_1)
elif 25 <= self.craziness < 50:
  self.kid = random.choice(quarter_2)
elif 50 <= self.craziness < 75:
  self.kid = random.choice(quarter_3)
else:
  self.kid = random.choice(quarter_4)
```

Run the code and answer the following questions.

Hopefully the game will be the encouragement for you to go and start coding and have fun doing it. Good luck!
